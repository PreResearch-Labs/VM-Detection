# Abstract

This paper has been written during an *Introduction to Malware* class in a
French engineering school. We will be focusing on the runtime detection of 
virtualized environment. Most malware today uses complex techniques to detect
sandboxes and prevent their own execution, thus making their analysis more
complex. Through the following pages, we will come back on the differences
the different virtualisation techniques and then study the state of the art of 
today's virtual machines detection.
